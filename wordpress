<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;"><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">My Dear Newest Friend,</span><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;">You already know that your tourism officials don't care about your talents and won't promote you if you are not already big and affluent enough to compensate them. Your neighborhood flea market or 2nd hand goods store will never generate their attention. They don't assist the common person who doesn't have any famous landmark, 5-Star Hotel, golf course, or high-priced outfit. Am I right?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;">Even if most of the people in your neighborhood knew how to paint picturesque paintings, build things with their hands or cooked a lot of top-quality meals at reasonable costs, your tourism officials don't put you all into those fancy magazines you find in airplanes. All of that's about to change, change for the more favorable. With your name upon our mailing list we'll pressure them to assist the ordinary person who does not have a government tourism job paying a favourable salary.</span><span style="color: #999999;"><br /></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #999999; background-color: #ffff00;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: large;"><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Introducing www.7MillionJobs.com, where your offerings to holidaymakers could win you prizes every week, have you featured on TV, where you buy, sell and barter anything related to tourism, and we charge you nothing!</span> </span></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #999999; font-size: 12pt;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;">Your tourism officials won't advertise what you can do to earn tourism dollars but with your help we'll force them to do it in all 84 selected countries including Asia, Africa, Australia &amp; Pan America from Argentina to Alaska. And we won't charge commissions or take any of what you earn.</span></p>

<h3><strong>ANCIENT HISTORY SECTION</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Back in April, 2010 while in Los Angeles hanging with friends in the Multicultural Motion Picture Association(MMPA), I realized that Hollywood just wasn't what I really wanted. So around the 15th after I'd purchased a passport I flew to Taiwan. Since then I've been to the US only once and that was back in Sept 2019 to attend the funeral of my 2nd daughter <b>"Perrie Mason"</b>, who was murdered and dismembered by her jealous ex-boyfriend. Google will tell you all about that.</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;">So I've been running around to many countries in Asia during these 10 years and have noticed that every country has opportunities us tourists and expats often miss. There already is a well known group that will help you find someone's couch to sleep on. We tourists need one well known place to locate you locals to hire you for small jobs, errands and ect. Over in India I had to hire a local person just to get my SIM card activated in his name. This could happen to you, too. I've not seen a tourist Visa that allows employment. How about an App that helps you trade your skills and talents to someone in town for something you need?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;">I began searching for an App that would hook me up with local people who would gladly help me out, whether I wanted a guide to go visit "The Ghettos" or get my hair braided, a negotiator to help me get a better price at the markets or anything else. Since I didn't find this App I decided to create one myself. I can prove to you that creating an App is really easy to do, but you must 1st have a website that does exactly what you want the App to do.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>During my R&amp;D I heard about and attended a World Tourism Organization UNWTO / UNESCO World Conference on Tourism and Culture in Siem Reap, Cambodia, 4-6 February 2015 about "Building a New Partnership". Now you are about to become my partner along with lots of other people in 84 different countries. I'm sending you a digital copy of that 145 page PDF received by everyone attending the Conferences and Seminars, because I want everyone to call it "The Constitution". I've designed this entire 7MillionJobs.com project around what you see in the Constitution, as I call it. You'll want to know where we are going and how we will do things in your neighborhood, so you need to read the Constitution.</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">If you want to be really impressed just look at the names and titles of some of the presenters teaching us. Let me quote you what it says on a page "The first World Conference on Tourism and Culture: Building a New Partnership was held on 4 and 5 February 2015 in the city of Siem Reap, Cambodia, jointly organized by UNWTO and UNESCO, and <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">hosted by His Majesty Preah Samdech Preah Baromneath Norodom Sihamoni, King of Cambodia</span>, and the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia."</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Don't you want His Majesty to be pleased to see that you and almost everyone you know is getting involved in these part-time travel and tourism related jobs? Then with his help this project will kick into high gear and you will begin seeing results.</strong> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Yes it took me longer than expected to create a software system that almost anyone with a mobile phone can quickly and easily master, but you will see we now accomplish 98% of what "the Constitution" says needs to be done. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">You probably didn't attend the Conferences but can soon download and read what was discussed about the Main objectives and conclusions.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Because cultural routes offer important opportunities for tourism development, you will understand why these 84 countries were carefully selected for all of us to easily assist each other to earn profits in our new partnership model. You need to get in now, learn this simple system and make a one minute promotional video offering to help others get going. Remember, You'll have free access to upload your promotional video into as many of the top 30 travel tourism categories where it can be seen by anyone on YouTube and especially by tourists in our 84 countries.</span></span></p>
<p>Bringing 7 million jobs into your country brings tourism cash but should not destroy your neighborhood. We agree in promoting and safeguarding culture because the natural and cultural assets of any nation or community must be valued and protected. Tourists will hire you to be friendly and offer to show them something different. Make a video about taking them to the cemetery to tell stories about some of the dead bodies buried there. Offer to introduce them to the families in your neighborhood, take some photos and tell why you like living there.</p>
<p>What you need to know about living cultures and creative industries<br />such as music, cinema, crafts, architecture or design. You have the top 30 categories of tourism activities so you can upload a different one minute promotional video into each one, telling tourists how hiring you to learn more about these in your neighborhood is their best investment. This gives you an increasing role to play in creating an incomparable visitor experience that tourist won't soon forget.</p>
<p>Think about how quickly your fame and cash could really increase if one of your videos goes viral. Our future TV Shows could feature your services and offer you a prize and extra popularity. So have fun making videos tourists can brag about hiring you. Subscribe to our 7MillionJobs YouTube channel so you won't miss anything.</p>
<p><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><em>Tourists want to have fun so give them what they want</em></span>.</strong> When they have searched your profile for the perfect things to do and they don't find it then many of them will upload a video that you can watch. Their video explains their perfect vacation and how to contact them if you can help out. You will see this in each of our 84 countries. Subscribe now and be the 1st to give them the best vacations they will remember.</p>
<p>When you read the Main objectives and conclusions about Linking people along cultural tourism routes you will be glad to see our especially picked 84 countries all have these very profitable highways. This entire project is designed to encourage tourists to get off the main roads and come do business with you.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The urban regeneration through cultural tourism opportunities is where entire neighborhoods ban together to brag about why tourists can't resist and will enjoy visiting you. Each one of you could tell about the meanings of certain grafitti, neighborhood differences and other stories tourists would love to know about. You'll get more ideas by reading the Constitution and by just searching what other countries are doing. There must be something special about your neighborhood else why would you stay there? Let some tourists pay you to find out.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;">Once you have your name with a $1 donation on the list to prove you are interested, then I will use my power and friends in high places to get your Officials to follow <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a plan that guarantees that every tourist in your country</span> hears about www.7MillionJobs.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;">Another way our plan helps you is because together we insist they put your 7MillionJobs website on all tourism advertising, so that your profile and what you can do for tourists will be seen in Asia, Africa, Australia and Pan America. This means 84 countries could provide millions in free advertising for ALL each one of us. Reflect upon that one again.<br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;">Every Immigration Office &amp; Checkpoint in your country will have your sign so all tourists will know to visit this website. Then tourists will discover the other 83 countries in our new partnership and will start doing more and more business with us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This won't work in your country until I can show them that you people are very interested and want this all to happen. Yes, you can register as "anonymous." They will aslo check to see how many of you also have subscribed to 7MillionJobs in YouTube. I'll send you the link. <br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When</span> I have received enough names supporting your country then I will be able to setup everything needed and notify everyone so you can add your profile and start uploading videos that will make tourists want to hire you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;">Your Officials will not want to look bad with so many of you letting them know you want them to help us and not just the super wealthy. Our webpage about your country will let you know the latest. Just to be sure, put the name of your country on your donation. You can count on me to use my power and friends in high places to get cooperation with your Tourism Officials.</span></p>
